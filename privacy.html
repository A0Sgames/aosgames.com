                Privacy Policy for our Games and Apps

                Effective Date: [Date]

                Welcome to [Your Game Name]! This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our 2D mobile game (the "Game").

                Information We Collect

                We do not collect any personal data from our players. The only information we access is your internet connection to serve advertisements within the Game.

                Use of Information

                The internet access is used solely for the purpose of displaying third-party advertisements. We do not collect, store, or use any personal data from our players for any other purposes.

                Advertising

                We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you play our Game. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other applications to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

                Data Security

                We prioritize the security of your information. As we do not collect any personal data, there is no risk of your personal information being misused. The internet access is used strictly for advertising purposes and nothing else.

                Children's Privacy

                Our Game is intended for a general audience and does not knowingly collect any personal data from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.

                Changes to This Privacy Policy

                We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
